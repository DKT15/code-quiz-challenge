JavaScript project to demonstrate how I work with more advanced topics in Javascript.

## Description

I have created my project to demonstrate my basic knowledge of Javascript. I use local storage, if statements etc. I haven't been able to completely finish it just yet, but this is a learning project so will go back to it!Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done. Refer to the code file to see the code.

## Installation

Using the live link will enable you to use this application. Right-click and then select 'inspect.' Afterwards, go to the 'console' tab. This will show you what I have printed on the console.

## Usage

Refer to the console in the Chrome dev tools to see what I have done and refer to the code file to see the code.
